# Modelling-of-Protein-PIP-Lipid-Interactions.

**Introduction**

Phosphoinositides (PIs) are a subclass of phospholipids that play a central role in regulating membrane dynamics, intracellul
ar signaling, and organelle identity in eukaryotic cells. These lipids are derived
from phosphatidylinositol (PI) through reversible phosphorylation at positions 3, 4, and 5 of the inositol ring, generating s eve n distinct PI species. Each species is spatially and temporally restricted to
specific membrane compartments, acting as both second messengers and molecular tags that coordinate the recruitment and activ ity of proteins involved in signaling cascades, vesicle trafficking, and
cytoskeletal remodeling. The interaction between PIs and proteins is mediated through specialized lipid binding domains such as Pleckstrin Homology (PH), FYVE, Phox Homology (PX), and C2 domains.
These domains recognize specific PI phosphorylation patterns and contribute to membrane targeting and downstream functional r esp onses. Despite extensive characterization of canonical PI binding
modules, recent evidence has suggested that other domains, such as SKICH (Skeletal muscle and Kidney enriched Inositol phosphata se Carboxyl Homology), may also mediate interactions with PIs. Notably,
SKICH domains in proteins such as SKIP and PIPP appear to contribute to plasma membrane localization, raising the possibility of non canonical PIP binding mechanisms. However, predicting and validating
such interactions remains challenging due to the electrostatic complexity of PI headgroups, the flexibility of lipid protein int erfaces, and the limited availability of high resolution structural data. In this
study, we assess the ability of molecular docking tools to model PI protein interactions, including novel associations involving SKICH domains. We hypothesize that computational docking can capture the
key structural and electrostatic features required for PI recognition and that predicted interfaces will be supported by evol uti onary conservation, in silico mutagenesis, and experimental validation.

**Conclusions and Future Works (Disscussion)**

To identify candidate residues for mutagenesis, it is essential to determine which specific regions or amino acid residues withi n t he protein interact directly with the phosphoinositide head groups

Understanding the structural basis of this interaction not only facilitates targeted mutational analysis but also provides insight into the co nsequences of disrupted lipid binding

Characterizing how the loss of phosphoinositide binding alters the subcellular localization and function of the protein can reveal mechanist ic links to disease pathogenesis and

Elucidate how lipid protein interactions coordinate cellular signaling and trafficking machinery . And to collect more data Ex INPP5K, NDP52, TAX1BP1, IP Ligands and explore their characterstics
